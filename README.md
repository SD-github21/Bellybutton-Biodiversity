# Bellybutton Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview of Bellybutton Biodiversity Analysis
The purpose of the Bellybutton Biodiversity Analysis was to assist a biological research lab with building a webpage to publish their biological research data of bellybutton bacterial samples. The webpage is designed to allow researchers as well as the volunteers who provided the bacterial samples the ability to view a dashboard containing various data visualizations of the biological data of all the research participants. Visitors to the webpage will be able to select an individual ID number of anyone who participanted in the research study from a drop-down menu and view:

  - A panel of demographic information about the research participant
  - A bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found in that person's bellybutton
  - A gauge meter depicting bellybutton washing frequency
  - A bubble chart depicting bacteria cultures per sample

The webpage has been enhanced with the following customizations:
  - A color scheme as indicated by bright pink and purple font colors contrasted against a white background of the jumbotron's heading and subheading as well as the pink background color of the whole webpage
  - Adjustments to the margins and layout of the bar chart and gauge meter 
  - A background image within the banner of the jumbotron. 

In addition to providing a dynamic visualization of each research participant's data that will enhance greater understanding about bellybutton bacteria, research volunteers will be able to see what bacteria are present in their bellybuttons and learn if their bacteria will be useful for "Improbable Beef", a company that produces plant-based  products that mimic the taste and appearance of beef.
